    /*
    For hw-03, the instructions say to use an external JavaScript file. However, you'll notice none of the tasks
    in the instructions require JavaScript. This was a typo in the instructions, because I adjusted the assignment
    based on what we covered in class. Here's what we will do:
•	You are not required to add/use an external .js file for hw-03 as it is written.
•	You may earn up to 10 bonus points by adding a functioning button to your webpage. The button should modify
    the page in some way every time it is clicked, and you can choose how it modifies the page. Be sure to make
    sure your button works consistently, and that no error messages print to your developer console.
