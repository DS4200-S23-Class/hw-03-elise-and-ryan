                </ul>
                <h2> Channels </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Channel: Color</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Attribute: Categorical (Which Party the Electoral Votes
                        would have gone to) </li>
                        <li> This is a great choice and use of the channel. Since this
                        visualization is helping us see theoretical electoral vote
                        distribution across the country, it makes the most sense for the
                        visualization to be a map of the U.S. which each of the states
                        represented by a color representative of the party of the
                        winning candidate. This makes the visualization easy to understand. </li>

                <h2> Colormap </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Categorical (Blue and Red) </li>

                        <li> Attribute: Categorical (Which Party the Electoral Votes
                        would have gone to) </li>
                        <li> As stated in the Channel section, this is a great color map choice.
                        It clearly illustrates the dichotomy of choice in the major presidential
                        election. </li>

                <h2> Marks </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Points </li>
                </ul>
                <h2> Channels </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Channel: Color</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Attribute: Divergent (LWTS scoring value of batted balls) </li>
                        <li> This is a helpful choice of channel, but could be executed better.
                        It illustrates the idea that ball quality can range from below to above average,
                        not just average to really great. However, the color choices representing the
                        2 extremes may not be accessible to all users. Additionally, pink and orange
                        do not typically connote opposites, so it may be more prudent to pick more
                        disparate colors at opposite ends of the color wheel. It may also be a better idea
                        to pick darker colors so that the difference in tint/gradient is more pronounced.
                        As it stands, all of the colors are quite bright, which can be difficult to discern.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Channel: Horizontal Position </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Attribute: Sequential (exit velocity in mph) </li>
                        <li> This seems like a reasonable channel choice. The point
                        of this visualization is to compare the quality of a batted ball
                        based on its exit velocity and launch angle. Plotting these
                        two factors on the x and y axis is one way to visualize the
                        "sweet spot" balance of these two factors to bat the optimal ball.
                        </br> One thing that could be considered as an alternative is to instead
                        visualize the exit velocity by literally plotting points with their velocity
                            acting as the distance relative to the origin (0,0). This could help as a more
                        literal path of where the ball goes may be easier for industry professionals
                        to understand, where as this traditional x and y axis scatter plot is
                        more accessible to everyone. </li>

                <h2> Colormap </h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Divergent (ranging from Orange and Pink extremes) </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Attribute: Divergent (LWTS scoring value of batted balls) </li>
                        <li> As stated in the Channel section, this is good colormap concept choice, but
                        could have improved execution. We need a way to represent below and above average
                        balls where we can easily differentiate above average from below average. However,
                        the 2 extremes being orange and pink and all hues being relatively bright can
                        make the differences hard to discern on certain displays or with certain users.
                        To make the visualization more accessible, the two extremes should be darker hues
                        that are opposites on the color wheel. For example, the blue and red from
                        the above visualization would be great choices to represent two opposite extremes.</li>
